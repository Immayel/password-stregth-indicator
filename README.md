# password-stregth-indicator
A textual representation of a password's strength as entered by the user is known as a password strength indication. The length of the password determines the strength of the password on this website.
If the password is less than 4, it is weak; if it is greater than 4, but less than 8, it is medium strength. Finally, if the password is more than eight characters, the user must enter a strong password.
In this webpage, I wrote the code by HTML, CSS, and JS.
